/// Keep WebKitGTK away from the renderer NVIDIA's driver cannot survive.
///
/// Since 2.40 WebKitGTK composites through a DMA-BUF renderer, and on the
/// proprietary NVIDIA driver its web process segfaults inside
/// `libnvidia-eglcore` while tearing a GL context down. From outside that looks
/// like the tray icon arriving and the window never following. Turning the
/// renderer off costs a little smoothness on a panel that is mostly still
/// pictures.
///
/// There is nothing to read in advance, so it is learned: every start leaves a
/// `no-paint` marker and `ui_ready` removes it once something has been drawn.
/// A start that finds the file knows the previous run drew nothing, and writes
/// `soft-render` so this machine does not get the DMA-BUF renderer again.
/// Delete that file to try once more, after a driver update say.
///
/// NOT every failure to paint is the renderer. An EGL abort of the form
/// `Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER` on a machine with
/// no NVIDIA module is the AppImage shadowing the host's wayland libraries with
/// its own bundled copies, so the host's Mesa cannot load — see
/// `docker/trim-appimage.sh`. That aborts in the loader, before a renderer is
/// chosen, and falling back here only writes `soft-render` on a machine whose
/// renderer was never at fault.
///
/// Set before GTK starts, which is why it lives at the top of `run`, and while
/// the process is still single-threaded, which is what makes setting it safe.
/// A user who has already chosen a renderer is left alone.
