//! What the run looks like from the outside: the session in Discord.
//!
//! The Discord client on the same machine listens on a named pipe (Windows) or
//! a socket in the runtime directory (everywhere else). An application that
//! connects to it may set one activity, which Discord then shows under the
//! player's name. Nothing travels further than that pipe — the status is drawn
//! by the local client, and the tracker still talks to no server of its own.
//!
//! The status exists only while Hero Siege does. The app starts with the
//! machine and sits in the tray all day; a status that announced it all day
//! would say nothing about what the player is actually doing.
